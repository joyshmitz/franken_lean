//! Hardened trap-on-write probe (bead fln-wgp slice 2 — region hygiene,
//! plan §6.4): after `seal`, a region mapping is immutable three ways, and
//! this probe proves each one as a separate mode for the e2e drill:
//!
//! * `no-write` — the sealed mapping stays fully readable (positive control);
//! * `safe-write` — the safe surface refuses mutation with the typed
//!   `MapError::Sealed`, never a fault (FL-INV-07 on the API plane);
//! * `raw-write` — a raw pointer write to the sealed page (the move a buggy
//!   plugin or JIT stub would make through the ABI membrane) dies by SIGSEGV.
//!   The parent harness asserts the signal; if the write *survives*, the probe
//!   reports the broken hardening and exits 5 so the lane fails loudly.
//!
//! Emits NDJSON facts (schema `fln-region-trap/1`) on stdout. Exit codes:
//! 0 = mode's law held (for `raw-write` the process must instead die by
//! signal), 2 = usage, 3 = setup failure, 4 = safe surface failed to refuse,
//! 5 = raw write did not trap.
