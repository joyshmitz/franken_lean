//! **fln-unsafe-abi** — Marrow's boundary crate — object layout, tagged-pointer arithmetic, compacted-region relocation, `dlopen` of Reference-ABI plugins, and the exported `lean_*` symbol surface (plan §6, D3).
//!
//! D3 boundary crate: `unsafe` is permitted here ONLY at narrowly scoped
//! `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` sites, each carrying a `// UNSAFE-LEDGER: FLN-UL-NNNN`
//! marker and a matching row in `ci/UNSAFE_LEDGER.txt` (path, invariant, evidence,
//! safe fallback, no-claim boundary). CI rejects unledgered sites. This crate
//! must never depend on `fln-kernel` or `fln-checker` (D3 law a).
//!
//! Bead fln-lld (slice 1) implements the CompatHeap core: the `lean_object`
//! object model with layouts generated from the pinned contract
//! ([`contract`]), membrane-only allocation with the pin's `LEAN_MIMALLOC`
//! observables ([`membrane`]), per-category constructors/accessors
//! ([`object`]), tri-state reference counting with iterative teardown
//! ([`rc`]), tagged-pointer scalars ([`tagged`]), debug ownership shadows
//! ([`shadow`]), and the safe RAII prototype of the eventual fln-rt surface
//! ([`handle`]). Slice 2 opens the reviewed Rust surface: [`handle`] (the
//! safe RAII `Obj` API), [`rc`] (the `Header` view), and [`shadow`] (the
//! ownership-shadow controls) are public, with every exported item carrying
//! a reviewed row in `ci/BOUNDARY_API.txt` — the type-aware half of the D3
//! no-admission export covenant, enforced both directions plus post-expansion
//! by `tools/structure-guard` (FLN-STRUCT-022/025). The raw membrane
//! (`membrane`/`object`/`tagged`/`contract`) stays crate-internal. Bead
//! franken_lean-83r (slice 1) opens the exported `lean_*` C symbol surface
//! ([`export`]): census-signatured `#[unsafe(export_name)]` wrappers over
//! the membrane/object/rc twins, per-symbol status rows in
//! `ci/ABI_EXPORT_STATUS.txt` (§6.5 taxonomy, no unclassified symbol,
//! guard-enforced both directions), and the size-prefixed small heap that
//! serves the pin's sizeless `mi_free` shape. The remaining doors (`dlopen`,
//! outbound linking artifacts) stay with beads franken_lean-sno / fln-kok.
//!
//! Slice-1 typed restrictions (tracked, never silent):
//! * scheduled tasks/promises (`m_imp != NULL`) — bead fln-3gv (effects on
//!   asupersync);
//! * forcing thunks / applying closures / external `m_foreach` traversal —
//!   bead franken_lean-7xe (Golem apply machinery);
//! * compacted-region loading — bead fln-wgp; the owned allocator — fln-8w8;
//!   mpz arithmetic — the fln-bignum shim (Crucible workstream).
