//! CompatHeap membrane allocation (plan §6.1b, beads fln-lld / franken_lean-83r).
//!
//! Every CompatHeap object is minted and released ONLY through this module.
//! The size/`m_cs_sz` discipline mirrors the pin's distributed build exactly
//! (`LEAN_MIMALLOC` defined in the toolchain's `include/lean/config.h`):
//!
//! * small path (`lean_alloc_small_object`, `lean.h:409-432`): size is
//!   aligned up to `OBJECT_SIZE_DELTA` and the aligned size is stored in
//!   `m_cs_sz` at allocation time; header init leaves it in place.
//! * big path (`lean_alloc_object`, `object.cpp:355-376` — arrays, scalar
//!   arrays, strings, closures): exact requested size, `m_cs_sz = 0`.
//! * ctor memory (`lean_alloc_ctor_memory`, `lean.h:434-465`): small path
//!   plus zero-initialization of the final word when alignment padded the
//!   request, preserving the sharing-maximizer determinism upstream relies
//!   on (`maxsharing.cpp`/`compact.cpp` comment at `lean.h:441-449`).
//!
//! **The small heap is size-prefixed** (bead franken_lean-83r): under the
//! pin's `LEAN_MIMALLOC` config the C inlines free small objects *sizelessly*
//! (`lean_free_small_object` → `mi_free(o)`, `lean.h:490-497` — and the
//! header comment at `lean.h:125-131` warns `m_cs_sz` may be repurposed by
//! free time, so the allocator must not read it). We adopt upstream's OWN
//! fallback discipline for exactly this problem — the non-mimalloc path at
//! `lean.h:425-429` stores the size in one word before the object
//! (`*(size_t*)mem = sz; return (size_t*)mem + 1`). Every small block, Rust-
//! or C-minted, carries that hidden prefix, so `mi_free`-shaped sizeless
//! release and Rust sized release resolve to one free path. The prefix is
//! invisible at the ABI: object pointers, layouts, and header facts are
//! unchanged (C4 rig).
//!
//! Internal allocation failure aborts the process
//! (`std::alloc::handle_alloc_error`) — an abort, never a Rust panic
//! unwinding toward an ABI boundary (§6.5 panic law). The *exported* C
//! surface instead mirrors the pin's observable OOM behavior
//! (`lean_internal_panic_out_of_memory`); see `export.rs`. The owned
//! size-classed allocator with the heartbeat hook replaces `std::alloc`
//! underneath this interface in bead fln-8w8; the membrane discipline and
//! observable header facts are already final here.
