# KERNEL_CONTRACT.md — the Judgment Specification

**Version:** 1 (epoch `v4.32.0`) · **Bead:** franken_lean-79k · **Status:** normative

This document is the rule-by-rule account of the type theory FrankenLean implements
(plan §8.1b, Appendix A). Both kernel engines (K1, K2), the independent checker, and
the Tribunal's term generators are built **against this document**; the pinned
Reference C++ is what this document is *checked against*, rule by rule, by the
differential harness — the inversion that is itself a product.

**How to read a rule.** Every rule carries: a stable id (`KR-NNN`); one or more
`anchor:` lines naming the exact Reference source location at the pin, with an
`expect="token"` that must appear on that line (drift fails CI); a `fixtures:` line
naming the evidence (or `stub owner=<bead>` naming who will supply it); and an
unambiguous statement a second implementer can code from. The document is CI-checked
like code by `crates/fln-conformance/tests/kernel_contract.rs`.

**Resource law (constitutional).** Every resource hook in §KR-4xx is *counted, never
semantic*: exhaustion is a verdict about a **run**, never about a **term** — it
surfaces as `KernelInconclusive`, never as rejection or acceptance (FL-INV-07).

**Literature baseline.** Mario Carneiro, *The Type Theory of Lean* (2019) is the
standing reference for the metatheory; rules below cite the pin's code as the
behavioral authority and the thesis for justification. Where the plan text and the
pin disagree (see KR-313's note on `Nat.blt`), **the pin governs and the divergence
is recorded here**.

---

## 1. Typing rules (KR-1xx)

Dispatcher: `infer_type_core` switches on the expression kind and memoizes per
`infer_only` mode.

### KR-100 · Preconditions — closed terms, resource hook
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:270 (infer_type_core) expect="infer_type_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every inference first rejects loose bound variables ("replace them with free
variables before invoking") and runs the counted resource hook (KR-400). Terms
reaching the kernel are closed with respect to de Bruijn variables.

### KR-101 · Bound variables are unreachable
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:287 (infer_type_core) expect="BVar"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Given KR-100 and binder telescoping (KR-106/107/108), a raw `bvar` at the dispatcher
is an internal invariant violation, not a user-reachable state.

### KR-102 · Free variables
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:84 (infer_fvar) expect="infer_fvar"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
An `fvar` types as the type recorded in its local-context declaration; an unknown
free variable is an error.

### KR-103 · Metavariables are rejected
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:286 (infer_type_core) expect="MVar"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The kernel never types a metavariable: elaboration artifacts must be fully
instantiated before admission.

### KR-104 · Sort
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:289 (infer_type_core) expect="Sort"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Sort u : Sort (u+1)`. In checking mode, `u` must reference only declared universe
parameters (KR-140).

### KR-105 · Constants
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:92 (infer_constant) expect="infer_constant"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`c.{ls}` requires the level-argument count to equal the declaration's
level-parameter count (both modes). In checking mode additionally: the unsafe
quarantine (KR-975), the partial quarantine (KR-976), and KR-140 on every level.
The type is the declaration's type with parameters instantiated by `ls`.

### KR-106 · Application
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:163 (infer_app) expect="infer_app"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Checking mode: the head's type is forced to a Π (via whnf; else "function
expected"); the argument's inferred type must be defeq to the domain (else "app type
mismatch"); the result is the codomain instantiated with the argument. Infer-only
mode walks the spine peeling syntactic Πs without the defeq domain checks. The
`eagerReduce` marker on an argument switches the defeq check into eager-reduction
mode for its duration.

### KR-107 · Lambda
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:116 (infer_lambda) expect="infer_lambda"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Telescoped: each domain (checking mode) must be a sort; the body is inferred under
the extended local context; the result is the Π-abstraction of the body type over
the telescope, after a cheap beta-reduction of the body type.

### KR-108 · Dependent function types — the imax rule
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:134 (infer_pi) expect="infer_pi"
fixtures: crates/fln-conformance/fixtures/core_observables.txt
`Π (x : A), B` where `A : Sort u` and `B : Sort v` types as
`Sort (imax u v)`, right-folded over the telescope. With KR-500's
`imax u 0 = 0` collapse this is exactly Prop impredicativity. Every domain must be a
sort even in infer-only mode (the universe is needed).

### KR-109 · Let
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:198 (infer_let) expect="infer_let"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Telescoped with value-carrying local declarations: in checking mode the declared
type must be a sort and the value's inferred type defeq to it ("def type
mismatch"). The body types under the extended context.

### KR-110 · Literals
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:282 (infer_type_core) expect="Lit"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A `Nat` literal types as `Nat`; a `String` literal as `String`. No premises.

### KR-111 · Metadata is transparent
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:283 (infer_type_core) expect="MData"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`mdata m e` types as `e`.

### KR-112 · Projections
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:221 (infer_proj) expect="infer_proj"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`proj I idx s`: the whnf of `s`'s type must be `I As` where `I` is an inductive with
exactly one constructor and `|As| = nparams + nindices`. The projected type is the
`idx`-th field domain of the constructor's telescope, with parameters instantiated
and earlier dependent fields substituted by nested projections of `s`. Prop guard:
see KR-901.

---

## 2. Weak-head normalization (KR-2xx)

### KR-200 · The whnf strategy
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:641 (whnf) expect="whnf"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Outer loop over: `whnf_core` (no delta), then native reduction (KR-318), then Nat
literal acceleration (KR-313), then one delta unfolding (KR-309's machinery); loop
until stable; positive results cached. Easy kinds (`bvar/sort/mvar/pi/lit`) return
immediately and are never cached.

### KR-201 · whnf-core performs no delta
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:401 (whnf_core) expect="whnf_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`whnf_core` handles metadata stripping, let-fvar zeta, beta, let-zeta, projection
reduction, and recursor dispatch — never definition unfolding and never normalizer
extensions. Results cache only when neither cheap flag is set.

### KR-202 · Beta
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:443 (whnf_core) expect="App"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Multi-argument beta in one batch: peel as many lambda binders as arguments are
available, instantiate, and continue reducing the residual application.

### KR-203 · Zeta — let and let-bound fvars
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:474 (whnf_core) expect="Let"
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:348 (whnf_fvar) expect="whnf_fvar"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`let x := v; b` reduces to `b[v/x]`; a let-bound free variable unfolds to its
recorded value.

### KR-204 · Projection reduction
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:359 (reduce_proj_core) expect="reduce_proj_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`proj I idx (mk As fs)` reduces to field `idx` (i.e. argument `nparams + idx`).
A `String` literal scrutinee is first expanded to its constructor form.

### KR-205 · Recursor dispatch
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:333 (reduce_recursor) expect="reduce_recursor"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
When the application head is stable, quotient computation (KR-955) is tried first
(when initialized), then inductive iota (KR-316). Unfolds are recorded in
diagnostics when enabled (never limiting; KR-404).

---

## 3. Definitional equality (KR-3xx)

Entry: `is_def_eq`, with positive results cached in the equivalence manager.

### KR-300 · Resource hook and quick equality
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1056 (is_def_eq_core) expect="is_def_eq_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every defeq query runs the counted resource hook, then the quick check.

### KR-301 · Quick structural/hash equality
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:740 (quick_is_def_eq) expect="quick_is_def_eq"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Pointer/structural/cached equality via the equivalence manager; same-kind fast
paths: bindings (KR-302), sorts by level equivalence (KR-303), metadata by payload,
literals by value.

### KR-302 · Binder congruence
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:690 (is_def_eq_binding) expect="is_def_eq_binding"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Π/λ compare domain-wise then body-wise under a fresh local (introduced only when
the bound variable occurs).

### KR-303 · Level equality
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:719 (is_def_eq) expect="is_def_eq"
fixtures: crates/fln-conformance/fixtures/core_observables.txt
Sorts are defeq iff their levels are equivalent under level normalization (KR-500).

### KR-304 · The decide shortcut
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1066 (is_def_eq_core) expect="m_eager_reduce"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
When the left side is closed (or eager reduction is on) and the right side is the
constant `Bool.true`, a full whnf of the left side deciding to `Bool.true` closes
the query.

### KR-305 · Cheap normalization, projections deferred
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1079 (is_def_eq_core) expect="whnf_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Both sides normalize without delta and with projection unfolding deferred, so
`a.i ≟ b.i` can first try `a ≟ b`.

### KR-306 · Definitional proof irrelevance in Prop
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:836 (is_def_eq_proof_irrel) expect="is_def_eq_proof_irrel"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
If the type of the left side is a proposition, the two terms are defeq iff their
types are defeq. The sole condition is `is_prop` of the type.

### KR-307 · The lazy-delta ladder
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:973 (lazy_delta_reduction) expect="lazy_delta_reduction"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Loop: Nat offset check (KR-308); Nat/native literal reduction on closed sides; one
lazy delta step (KR-309); repeat until decided or stable.

### KR-308 · Nat successor offsets
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:961 (is_def_eq_offset) expect="is_def_eq_offset"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Nat.succ`-shaped sides (including literals > 0 viewed as successors) compare by
peeling predecessors — large literals never unfold unarily.

### KR-309 · Delta ordering by definitional height
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:884 (lazy_delta_reduction_step) expect="lazy_delta_reduction_step"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
When only one side has an unfoldable head, unfold it — except that a projection
application on the other side unfolds first. When both are unfoldable, the
`ReducibilityHints` comparison decides: the greater definitional height unfolds
first; at equal heights both unfold, but two applications of the *same* regular
definition first try level+argument congruence, with negative results cached.
Reducibility *attributes* never change kernel behavior — only the recorded hints
(height) do; this is the reducibility-independence law.

### KR-310 · Post-delta syntactic closure
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1094 (is_def_eq_core) expect="is_constant"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Same-name constants with equivalent levels, identical fvars, and same-index
projections (whose scrutinees compare under lazy projection reduction) close the
query.

### KR-311 · Application congruence
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:815 (is_def_eq_app) expect="is_def_eq_app"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
After a full-whnf projection retry, applications compare head-and-args pointwise.

### KR-312 · Eta — functions and structures
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:778 (try_eta_expansion_core) expect="try_eta_expansion_core"
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:793 (try_eta_struct_core) expect="try_eta_struct_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Function eta: a lambda against a non-lambda eta-expands the non-lambda through its
Π-type, both directions. Structure eta: `t ≟ mk as fs` for a one-constructor,
non-recursive, index-free structure holds when the types agree and every field
`fᵢ` is defeq to `t.i`, both directions.

### KR-313 · Nat literal acceleration — the exact operation set
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:609 (reduce_nat) expect="reduce_nat"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
On `Nat` literals the kernel computes: `succ`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod`,
`gcd`, `pow` (exponent capped at 2^24), `beq`, `ble`, `land`, `lor`, `xor`,
`shiftLeft`, `shiftRight`. **Divergence note (pin governs):** the plan's Appendix A
lists `blt`; at this pin there is no `Nat.blt` acceleration — only `beq`/`ble`.
Gated on closed terms (or eager reduction).

### KR-314 · String literal rules
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1030 (try_string_lit_expansion_core) expect="try_string_lit_expansion_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A `String` literal is defeq to its `String.ofList` constructor form, both
directions; projection and recursor machinery expand literals the same way.

### KR-315 · Unit-like eta
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1044 (is_def_eq_unit_like) expect="is_def_eq_unit_like"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Two terms of the same one-constructor, zero-field structure type are defeq when
their types are.

### KR-316 · Iota — recursor computation
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.h:76 (inductive_reduce_rec) expect="inductive_reduce_rec"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A recursor application fires when its major premise (at
`nparams + nmotives + nminors + nindices`) reduces to a constructor of the right
inductive — after K conversion (KR-317), Nat/String literal-to-constructor
conversion, and structure-eta coercion. The matching rule's right-hand side is
instantiated with the recursor's levels, applied to params, motives, minors, the
constructor's fields, and trailing arguments.

### KR-317 · K-like reduction
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:551 (init_K_target) expect="init_K_target"
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.h:31 (to_cnstr_when_K) expect="to_cnstr_when_K"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A recursor supports K exactly when its inductive is non-mutual, Prop-valued, with
one constructor of zero fields. Then any major premise whose type is defeq to the
expected constructor type is replaced by the nullary constructor — reduction
without matching the syntactic proof.

### KR-318 · Native reduction hooks
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:546 (reduce_native) expect="reduce_native"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Lean.reduceBool` / `Lean.reduceNat` evaluate via the compiled evaluator — the
`native_decide` trust surface. FrankenLean preserves the semantics and marks every
dependent theorem in provenance (plan §Limitations).

---

## 4. Resource accounting (KR-4xx) — counted, never semantic

### KR-400 · Inference hook
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:274 (infer_type_core) expect="check_system"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every inference node counts.

### KR-401 · Normalization hook
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:402 (whnf_core) expect="check_system"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every whnf-core entry counts.

### KR-402 · Defeq hook
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:1057 (is_def_eq_core) expect="check_system"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every defeq query counts.

### KR-403 · The counter mechanism
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/runtime/interrupt.cpp:81 (check_system) expect="check_system"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The hook probes stack and memory, checks interruption, and increments the
thread-local heartbeat, throwing on exceeding the configured maximum. There is no
separate recursion-depth counter in the kernel proper; recursion is bounded by the
stack probe. In FrankenLean, every such exhaustion is a typed `KernelInconclusive`
(FL-INV-07): a verdict about the run, never about the term.

### KR-404 · Diagnostics are never limits
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:497 (unfold_definition_core) expect="unfold_definition_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Unfold counting is instrumentation only; no diagnostic state may influence a
verdict.

---

## 5. Universe levels (KR-5xx)

### KR-500 · Level normalization, including imax collapse
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/Lean/Level.lean:379 (normalize) expect="normalize"
fixtures: crates/fln-conformance/fixtures/core_observables.txt
The level language (`zero/succ/max/imax/param/mvar`) normalizes per the pin's
algorithm: offsets stripped and re-added, `max` flattened, normalized, sorted, and
subsumption-pruned; `imax u v` with never-zero `v` becomes `max`; the collapse laws
`imax u 0 = 0`, `imax 0 u = u`, `imax 1 u = u`, `imax u u = u` hold. Prop
impredicativity (KR-108) depends on the first law. Implemented and
oracle-verified in fln-core.

### KR-501 · Level equivalence
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/Lean/Level.lean:407 (isEquiv) expect="isEquiv"
fixtures: crates/fln-conformance/fixtures/core_observables.txt
Two levels are equivalent iff equal or normalize-equal. Kernel defeq of sorts
(KR-303) consults exactly this relation.

---

## 6. Inductive validation (KR-6xx)

### KR-600 · Block preliminaries
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:216 (check_inductive_types) expect="check_name"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Each type's name and its recursor name must be fresh; the type closed (no
mvars/fvars) and well-typed under the block's level params; duplicate level params
rejected; the parameter count must be machine-small.

### KR-601 · Shared parameters across a mutual block
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:223 (check_inductive_types) expect="is_pi"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The first `nparams` binders of every type in the block must be defeq to the first
type's parameters, and the counts must match exactly; the remaining binders are
indices, counted per type.

### KR-602 · One universe per mutual block
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:245 (check_inductive_types) expect="ensure_sort"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The residual type of each block member must be a sort; all members' levels must be
equivalent to the first's.

### KR-603 · Constructor validity
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:413 (check_constructors) expect="check_constructors"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Constructor names unique and fresh; types closed and well-typed; the first
`nparams` domains defeq to the datatype parameters; every further field domain a
type; the result an application of the constructor's own inductive (KR-605).

### KR-604 · Field universes — the Prop exception
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:435 (check_constructors) expect="ensure_type"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Each non-parameter field's universe must be ≤ the datatype's resultant level —
unless the datatype lives in Prop, where fields of any size are admitted.

### KR-605 · Valid recursive occurrence shape
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:338 (is_valid_ind_app) expect="is_valid_ind_app"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A legal occurrence `I As is` names the block member exactly, has
`nparams + nindices` arguments, passes the declared parameters syntactically, and —
soundness-critical — no index argument may mention any datatype being declared.

### KR-606 · Strict positivity
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:393 (check_positivity) expect="check_positivity"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Reducing each safe constructor field to whnf: no occurrence ⇒ accepted; a Π whose
domain mentions the block ⇒ rejected (non-positive occurrence), recursing into the
codomain; a valid occurrence (KR-605) ⇒ a recursive argument; anything else
mentioning the block ⇒ rejected. Skipped entirely for unsafe inductives.

### KR-607 · Recursivity and reflexivity flags
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:264 (is_rec) expect="recursive"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`is_rec` iff some field mentions a block member; `is_reflexive` iff some field is
itself a function type whose body mentions a block member. Both are recorded
observables (fln-env mirrors them).

### KR-608 · Nested inductives compile to mutual blocks
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:1116 (add_inductive) expect="add_inductive"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Nested occurrences are rewritten to auxiliary `_nested.*` mutual types, validated
as a mutual block, then translated back; nested parameters may not contain loose
bound variables. The kernel never validates nesting directly.

---

## 7. Elimination universes (KR-7xx)

### KR-700 · When elimination is restricted to Prop
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:479 (elim_only_at_universe_zero) expect="elim_only_at_universe_zero"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A possibly-Prop inductive eliminates only into Prop when the block is mutual or has
more than one constructor. An *empty* Prop inductive eliminates large. A
single-constructor Prop inductive is decided by KR-701.

### KR-701 · The subsingleton criterion
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:509 (elim_only_at_universe_zero) expect="cnstr"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Large elimination for a one-constructor Prop inductive requires every
non-parameter field to be a Prop or to occur among the constructor result's
arguments.

### KR-702 · The elimination level
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:537 (init_elim_level) expect="init_elim_level"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Restricted ⇒ level 0; otherwise a fresh universe parameter `u` (collision-avoided)
is added to the recursor's level parameters.

---

## 8. Recursor generation (KR-8xx)

### KR-800 · Motives and major premise
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:589 (mk_rec_infos) expect="mk_rec_infos"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Per datatype: indices are collected, the major premise is `t : I params indices`,
and the motive is `C : Π indices, I params indices → Sort elim`; mutual blocks
number their motives.

### KR-801 · Minor premises with induction hypotheses
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:621 (mk_rec_infos) expect="ind_type"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Per constructor: non-parameter fields, then for each recursive field an induction
hypothesis `Π xs, C (u xs)`, concluding in the motive at the constructor
application.

### KR-802 · The recursor type
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:759 (declare_recursors) expect="d_idx"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Π params, Π motives, Π minors, Π indices, Π major, C indices major`, with strict
implicit inference; registered with `nparams/nindices/nmotives/nminors/rules/K/unsafe`.

### KR-803 · Iota right-hand sides
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/inductive.cpp:705 (mk_rec_rules) expect="mk_rec_rules"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Per constructor: `λ params Cs minors fields, minor fields ihs` where each ih is the
recursive call of the appropriate mutual recursor; the rule records the constructor
name and field count.

---

## 9. Structures and projections (KR-9xx)

### KR-900 · Projection typing
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:221 (infer_proj) expect="infer_proj"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
As KR-112: one constructor, exact arity, telescope substitution with nested
projections for dependent fields.

### KR-901 · No data escapes Prop through projections
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:248 (infer_proj) expect="is_prop"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Projecting from a Prop-valued structure requires every traversed dependent field
and the projected type itself to be a Prop.

### KR-902 · Projection computation
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:359 (reduce_proj_core) expect="reduce_proj_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`(mk … aᵢ …).i ⟶ aᵢ` — see KR-204.

### KR-903 · Structure eta coherence
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:793 (try_eta_struct_core) expect="try_eta_struct_core"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
As KR-312's structure half; the eligible class is exactly the non-recursive,
index-free, one-constructor structures, and the same coercion feeds recursor
reduction (KR-316).

## 10. Quotients (KR-95x)

### KR-950 · Initialization requires Eq
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.cpp:19 (check_eq_type) expect="check_eq_type"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Quotients initialize only in an environment whose `Eq` is the expected
one-parameter, one-constructor equality with `Eq.refl` of the expected type.

### KR-951 · Quot
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.cpp:59 (add_quot) expect="constant {u} quot"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Quot.{u} : Π {α : Sort u}, (α → α → Prop) → Sort u`.

### KR-952 · Quot.mk
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.cpp:63 (add_quot) expect="quot.mk"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Quot.mk.{u} : Π {α : Sort u} (r : α → α → Prop), α → @Quot α r`.

### KR-953 · Quot.lift
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.cpp:82 (add_quot) expect="quot.lift"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Quot.lift.{u,v}` with the soundness premise `∀ a b, r a b → f a = f b`.

### KR-954 · Quot.ind
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.cpp:92 (add_quot) expect="quot.ind"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Quot.ind.{u}` eliminating into Prop-valued motives; initialization is then marked.

### KR-955 · Quot computation
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/quot.h:39 (quot_reduce_rec) expect="quot_reduce_rec"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
`Quot.lift f h (Quot.mk r a) ⟶ f a` (mk at position 5, f at 3);
`Quot.ind p (Quot.mk r a) ⟶ p a` (mk at 4); trailing arguments preserved; active
only when initialized.

## 11. Declaration admission (KR-97x)

### KR-970 · One name, one constant
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:102 (check_name) expect="check_name"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Every added constant's name must be fresh; fln-env enforces the same law as a typed
refusal.

### KR-971 · Distinct level parameters
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:111 (check_duplicated_univ_params) expect="check_duplicated_univ_params"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A declaration's universe parameters must be pairwise distinct.

### KR-972 · Well-formed constant preamble
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:127 (check_constant_val) expect="check_constant_val"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Fresh name, distinct level params, closed type (no mvars/fvars), and the type
itself checks to a sort.

### KR-973 · Axioms
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:152 (add_axiom) expect="add_axiom"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
An axiom is its checked type; no body, no defeq obligation.

### KR-974 · Definitions, theorems, opaques
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:160 (add_definition) expect="add_definition"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The body's inferred type must be defeq to the declared type; theorems additionally
require a Prop-valued type; unsafe definitions check header-first to permit
recursion.

### KR-975 · The unsafe quarantine
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:101 (infer_constant) expect="is_unsafe"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Safe code may not reference unsafe declarations; unsafe code may reference
anything. One-directional, no exceptions.

### KR-976 · The partial quarantine
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp:105 (infer_constant) expect="partial"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
Safe definitions may not reference partial definitions.

### KR-977 · Mutual definitions are unsafe-only
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:224 (add_mutual) expect="add_mutual"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
A mutual definition block must be non-empty, must not be tagged safe, and all
members must share one safety annotation; headers first, then each body defeq to
its type.

### KR-978 · The unchecked door is not a rule
anchor: vendor/lean4-src/src/kernel/environment.cpp:275 (lean_add_decl) expect="lean_add_decl"
fixtures: stub owner=franken_lean-z6c
The Reference exposes an add-without-checking entry point. In FrankenLean nothing
outside `fln-kernel` can admit a constant (FL-INV-02); trust-level bypasses are
journaled and surfaced in receipts, never silent (plan §4.1 wire/CLI row).

## Revision law

This document is versioned per epoch. Amending a rule statement is a reviewed
change that must touch the rule's linked fixtures in the same change (enforced
during review; mechanized as part of the verification-manifest work under
franken_lean-rur). Anchors are re-verified against every epoch advance; a drifted
anchor blocks the epoch claim until the rule is re-confirmed or a Behavior Note
records the divergence.
